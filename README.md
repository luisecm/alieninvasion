# Alien Invasion game
Alien Invasion game project from Python Crash Course

Alien invasion game written in Python for version 3.0

Click on "Play" to start the game
Press space bar to shoot the aliens
An entire fleet of aliens will be displayed on screen and you need to shoot them all, so you can pass to the next level
A new fleet of aliens will be created until you lose your three ships available for the game
You will lose when an alien hits the ground or hits your ship
Be careful because once that you kill an entire fleet, the speed of the game will increase
Try to beat the high score! I achieve until level 17, because at that level the game gets crazier!

Enjoy it and feel free to provide suggestions to improve the code
This is a very basic game created while learning python classes, objects, methods and the pygame library basics
Thanks for watching out!
